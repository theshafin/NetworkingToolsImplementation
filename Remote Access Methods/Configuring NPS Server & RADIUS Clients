# Configure Network Policy Server and RADIUS Clients

## Objective
- Install and configure the Network Policy Server (NPS) role.  
- Add RADIUS clients on the NPS server.  
- Create and apply a network policy for a specific group.  
- Configure VPN servers to use RADIUS for authentication and accounting.  

## Steps Performed
1. Installed the **Network Policy and Access Services** role.  
2. Configured **RADIUS clients** on the NPS server with a shared secret.  
3. Created a **network policy** for a user group, granting access and applying authentication settings.  
4. Configured **VPN servers** as RADIUS clients, enabling both authentication and accounting with the shared secret.  

## Key Points
- NPS centralizes authentication and policy management.  
- RADIUS clients must share the same secret with the NPS server.  
- Network policies define which groups are granted or denied access.  
- VPN servers rely on RADIUS for secure remote authentication and logging.
